-----------------

Description

-----------------



--This program shows a database of students, as an admin; you can view all students. The search function shows a user and all of their information, even if there are empty fields. Adding a student will not allow you to use a username that already exists, and same thing with adding a major. You cannot add unless they are unique. Deleting a student is just long clicking on the student you want to delete.

Problems

-----------------



--The only issue I ran into is time crunch. I wasn't able to implement Updating or viewing Details of a student sadly, but I will update this if I am allowed to edit my project and add those touches. Other than that, SQL is a weird language to get used to, but I feel a bit better with it, except for the quotations and where they should be placed, that still doesn't make much sense to me.
