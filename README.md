# CIS183\_HW03\_Program1\_MarcusRollins



-----------------

Description

-----------------



--This program shows a database of students, as an admin; you can view all students. The search function shows a user and all of their information, even if there are empty fields. Adding a student will not allow you to use a username that already exists, and same thing with adding a major. You cannot add unless they are unique. Deleting a student is just long clicking on the student you want to delete.



-----------------

Problems

-----------------


--Didn't run into many issues with this project, I had to fix the database to take Major_ID instead of Major_Name because it was breaking JOIN SQL statements. Other than that, I was able to complete the assignment.
